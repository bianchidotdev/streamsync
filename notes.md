# StreamSync Project Status Summary

## Project Overview
StreamSync is a Phoenix LiveView application for synchronizing music libraries between different streaming services (Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music). Users can connect multiple streaming accounts and sync their playlists/songs between services.

## Key Features Implemented
- **User Authentication**: Full phx.gen.auth setup with email-based login
- **OAuth Integration**: Support for Spotify and Tidal OAuth providers
- **Music Sync Interface**: 
  - Select source and destination streaming providers
  - Browse and select songs from source provider
  - Create sync jobs to transfer songs between services
- **Async Song Loading**: Uses Phoenix.LiveView.AsyncResult for loading songs
- **Job Management**: Basic sync job listing and management

## Technical Stack
- Phoenix 1.7.21 with LiveView
- SQLite database with Ecto
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- OAuth via Ueberauth (Spotify, Tidal)
- User provider connections for storing OAuth tokens

## Current State
- Authentication system is complete
- Basic UI framework is in place
- Song sync interface has mock data and placeholder functionality
- OAuth providers are configured but may need actual API implementations
- Job management system is mostly stubbed out

## Key Files
- Router: Full auth + sync routes configured
- SyncSongsLive: Main sync interface with provider selection and song management
- SyncLive.Index: Job listing interface (mostly placeholder)
- User provider connections for OAuth token storage

## Next Steps Needed
- Complete OAuth provider implementations
- Build actual API clients for Spotify/Tidal/Apple Music
- Implement real sync job processing
- Add proper error handling and user feedback
- Style the interface to match a cohesive design

## Dependencies of Note
- ueberauth_spotify and ueberauth_tidal (local path dependencies)
- req for HTTP requests
- bcrypt_elixir for authentication
- tidewave for local dev (Tidal API client)
