# streamsync

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```

## Goals
* v0.1 - Import individual playlist + tracks from spotify to tidal
* v0.2 - Sync all playlists (or subset) from spotify to tiday
* Implement port and adapter pattern so sync is not bound to spotify -> tidal
* Figure out auth in a way that's not as rough
